# automata

A cellular automaton simulator. Defaults to the Game of Life.

To test it out, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mel-brown/automata
cd automata
stack run
```

Pressing `P` will pause the simulation and allow you to left- and right-click to toggle cells. At any time you may press `Q` to quit.
